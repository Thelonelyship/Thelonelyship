# <p align="center">Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Allan.</p>
<p align="center">Thank you for visiting my page.</p>

## About Me
I am from, and am now based, in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
My degree is in Psychology from Bangor University in Wales, and I also studied Japanese Language at Waseda University in Tokyo.
I have also studied level 3 Criminology, English Language, Quantitative Methods and Time Management.
I have now completed the level 3 bootcamp in Software Development.

As you can tell, I enjoy learning new things and challenging myself!

Being an English teacher since 2016, I have learnt to break down tasks into manageable chunks in order to help people identify areas to focus on for their studies, which I think seems to help a lot with understanding code.


## Design
I have a keen eye for design and love to try to incorporate my unique characters and designs into projects.
I am a huge fan of fantasy worlds and have several original characters. My fox character being my favourite. :blush:
Here are a couple of examples:
